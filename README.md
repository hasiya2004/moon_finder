# moon_finder
this is made by lazuno and i m writing this code to help people to how to get start ai with java and ect so let's get start!

#we will explore how to use Java to retrieve moon information from NASA's API. We will make use of HttpURLConnection to send an HTTP GET request to the API, read the response, and extract the desired moon information. Let's get started!

##Setting up the project

To begin, create a new Java project in your preferred development environment. Make sure you have the required dependencies for making HTTP requests. In this example, we will use HttpURLConnection, which is available in the Java Standard Library.

##Obtaining NASA API Key

Before we can access the moon information from NASA's API, we need to obtain an API key. Visit the NASA API website (https://api.nasa.gov) and sign up for an account. Once registered, you will receive an API key that you can use to authenticate your requests.
